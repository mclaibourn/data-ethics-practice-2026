```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r scale, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../scales_images/dogscale.jpeg")
```

## forcats 

The [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) package provides helper functions for working with factors.

Good for changing data via mutate (and others)

* **fct_lump_n()**: collapse least/most frequent levels of factor into "other"
* **fct_collapse()**: collapse factor levels into defined groups
* **fct_recode()**: change factor levels by hand
* **fct_relevel()**: change order of factor levels by hand

Good for changing factors on the fly in ggplot

* **fct_infreq()**: reorder factor levels by frequency of levels
* **fct_reorder()**: reorder factor levels by another variable
* **fct_rev()**: reverse the order of the factor levels

## Comparing distributions
Beyond histograms

* Density plot: estimate the probability distribution of data with a curve
* Ridge plot: compare multiple density plots
* Box plot: show specific statistical summaries of a distribution
* Violin plot: compare multiple distributions/density plots
* Strip chart: show all the points, not just estimated distributions or statistical summaries
* Sina plot: an advanced strip chart, where the width of the jitter is controlled by the density distribution (like a violin)
* Raincloud plot: combining boxplot, density plot, strip chart!

## Comparing values
Beyond bar charts

* Dot plots: show the final value, not the whole bar
* Lollipop plots: add the line to the 0 point
* Dumbell plots: compare two values for each group
* Slope plots: compare two (or more) values for each group

## R Markdown
R Markdown creates dynamic documents by combining markdown (an easy to write plain text format) with embedded R code chunks. When compiled, the code can be evaluated so that the code, its output, and your prose can be included in the final document to make reports reproducible.

* R Markdown documents (.Rmd files) can be rendered to multiple formats including HTML and PDF. 
* The R code in an .Rmd document is processed by knitr, while the resulting .md file is rendered by pandoc to the final output formats (e.g. HTML or PDF).

## .Rmd file: YAML 

* A YAML header (yet-another-markup-language), offset by `----`
  - A good review of [YAML headers](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-4-yaml-headers.html)
  - Should include: Title/subtitle, author, date
  - Additional arguments: (Floating) Table of contents and code folding
  
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
----
title: "An incredible project"
subtitle: "Of great significance"
author: "Don't you know who I am?"
date: "2026-02-05"
output: html_document
----
```

## .Rmd file: Text

* Text with markdown formatting
  - A markdown format [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  - Common formatting: adding headers, adding emphasis, creating lists, creating links, etc.

## .Rmd file: R code

* Chunks of R code, offset by ``` (keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Opt/Alt + I)
  - knitr [code chunk options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)
  - `name` (to identify code chunk)
  - `echo = TRUE` (show code in document)
  - `message = FALSE`, `warning = FALSE` (prevent messages, warnings from appearing)
  - `fig.height = X, fig.width = X, fig.cap = "caption below the figure"` (control size of generated figure, presence of figure caption)

````markdown
`r ''````{r codechunkname, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 10}
# add code here
```
````
  - `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` (set global options, usually in first code chunk)
